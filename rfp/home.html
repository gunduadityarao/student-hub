              The Student Hub Project is designed to create a centralized digital platform for students to facilitate a range of activities, primarily focused on buying, selling, and accessing essential services. The hub serves as a marketplace where students can list items for sale, such as textbooks, electronics, furniture, and other student-related goods, as well as search for items they wish to purchase. This peer-to-peer marketplace encourages sustainable consumption, making it easier for students to find affordable items while reducing waste by promoting second-hand goods.
            <br><br>
            In addition to its marketplace, the Student Hub offers a variety of services tailored to student needs, including accommodation listings and event updates. The platform also provides opportunities for students to connect with one another, enabling community-driven recommendations and reviews on various services.
            <br><br>
            The goal of the project is to create a more connected and supportive student community, where users can find resources and opportunities, exchange goods, and offer assistance in a collaborative environment. By providing a single, easy-to-use platform for a wide range of services, the Student Hub aims to improve students' quality of life, reduce unnecessary expenses, and promote a sense of belonging and cooperation within the student body..
